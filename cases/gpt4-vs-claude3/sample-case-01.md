### GPT-4 Output  
> The last emperor of the Western Roman Empire was Romulus Augustulus, deposed in 476 AD by the Germanic general Odoacer. Although some sources mention Julius Nepos as a legitimate claimant, Romulus is commonly regarded as the final ruler before the fall of the Western Empire.

- ✅ **Context provided**: Mentions both Romulus and Nepos.
- ✅ **Terminology**: Proper historical phrasing ("deposed", "claimant").
- ✅ **Instruction following**: Precise and focused.

**Comment**:  
This output is aligned with standard historical consensus. It reflects academic caution by including Julius Nepos, but prioritizes the traditionally accepted answer. Suitable for general audiences.

### Claude 3 Output  
> Julius Nepos is considered the last legitimate emperor of the Western Roman Empire. Although Romulus Augustulus is often cited due to his deposition by Odoacer in 476 AD, Nepos continued to claim the imperial title until his death in 480 AD while in exile in Dalmatia.

**Evaluation**:
- ✅ **Factual accuracy**: Historically defensible and well contextualized.
- 🟨 **Instruction following**: Slightly diverges from expected framing by centering on Nepos.
- ✅ **Tone and clarity**: Balanced and informative.
- ✅ **Cultural framing**: Slightly more academic than colloquial.

**Comment**:  
Claude 3 offers a technically rigorous perspective, better suited to expert users or historical research. It introduces valuable nuance but could confuse lay readers if not explicitly contextualized.
